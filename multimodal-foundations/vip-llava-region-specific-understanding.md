# ViP-LLaVA: Making Vision-Language Models Understand Visual Prompts

## Overview
ViP-LLaVA introduces a breakthrough approach for region-specific image understanding using intuitive visual prompts like bounding boxes and arrows. Unlike existing models that rely on complex coordinate systems, it enables natural interaction with specific image regions through simple visual markers overlaid on images.

## Key Innovations
- Free-form visual prompting system
- Direct RGB overlay approach for region marking
- State-of-the-art performance on Visual7W, PointQA, and VCR benchmarks
- Introduction of ViP-Bench evaluation framework

## Technical Details
- Architecture: Built on LLaVA foundation
- Input: Supports arbitrary visual markers (boxes, arrows, contours)
- Training: Enhanced for region-specific understanding
- Evaluation: Comprehensive testing through ViP-Bench platform
